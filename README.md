### Hi there 👋, ![visitor badge](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=maaamie.visitor-badge&left_text=Welcome)
                
I'm just a guy who just learned Python a few days ago....
Anyway, what more do you want me to tell you?

I just started 3D printing too, but I can't do more... 😩, it keeps my wife awake....

And also, I automate the house thanks to "Home Assistant".

And I work in IT....

In short, what else to say? well you don't care...

In short, all that to tell you that.


if you like what i do, maybe a coffee ? 🥺👉👈
